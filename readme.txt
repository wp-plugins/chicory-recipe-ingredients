Chicory connects your recipes directly to leading online grocery stores.

== Description ==

Chicory connects your recipes directly to leading online grocery stores.



The Chicory recipe plugin displays a “get ingredients delivered’ button before or after your recipe, letting  readers cook the recipes they discover on your site without even having to make a trip to the grocery store.

Chicory’s intelligent shopping cart makes sure that users get the best products at the best prices for what they’re making whether they’re cooking for one or one hundred.

Chicory is awesome because:



*   It’s super easy to install (just add the plugin, select the location of the button, and continue creating recipes like normal).

*   Earn a commission every time a reader order the ingredients to one of your recipes.

*   Have complete control over location of the button, including a short code that allows you to put it anywhere on your template.

*   Doesn’t interfere with Ziplist, Easy Recipe or any other recipe plugins.

Note : The Chicory button only shows up and works if you’re a Chicory recipe partner.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I already have Ziplist or Easy Recipe. Can I also use Chicory? =


Yes! Chicory does not interfere with Ziplist or any other blogger tools or ad networks.

= Does Chicory affect my SEO? =


No. We do not negatively affect your SEO. We do frequently promote your recipes though so it may improve how often your links come up in searches!.

= Do I make money directly from the online grocery sales? =


Yes. You earn a commission every time someone orders the ingredients to recipes they found on your site.

= Is there a minimum order? =


This depends on the grocer a reader is ordering from and if they choose pickup or delivery. Most pickup locations do not require a minimum order.


To meet any minimum requirements, we recommend ordering a few recipes at once.

= Where do you deliver? =


We currently work in several hundred zip codes in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. We are continuously expanding to offer delivery in new areas.

= What if some of my users don’t have access to online grocer? =


Chicory is still a powerful shopping tool that shows readers what national brands they should purchase in store (and the quantity of those brands) when making your recipes.

= What if someone already has ingredients listed in a recipe? =


Easy! They can deselect the ingredients they already have and they will automatically be taken out of the shopping cart.
