== Description ==

Chicory connects your recipes directly to leading online grocery stores like Stop & Shop, Giant and Peapod for home delivery or grocery pickup.

The Chicory recipe plugin displays a “Get Ingredients” button right under the list of ingredients on each of your recipes, letting readers cook the recipes they discover on your site without having to make a trip to the grocery store.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What other blogs or websites do you work with? =
Chicory has recipe partners of all shapes and sizes. We work with Time, Inc. and can be found on MyRecipes.com.
But bloggers are at our core, with over 60 recipe partners currently on our team.
We appear on a variety of blogs—from daily recipe sites, to niche publications, to lifestyle blogs.
Check out some of our partners; Cookistry, Crock-Pot Ladies, Runaway Apricot, Kawaling Pinoy, Real Food by Dad or Hungry Couple.

= How will Chicory use my content, recipes or photos? =
As bloggers ourselves, we’re committed to sticking up for you and maintaining your content’s integrity.
We do not believe in repurposing your content without your explicit consent, and we wouldn’t ask to do so unless we felt it was in your interest.
The agreement you sign with us does grant us access to your photos, which we use for social media posts and on our blog, ALWAYS with a link back to your original post.

= Can I make money with Chicory? =
Yes! Because we are a growing company, our revenue share opportunities begin when our button reaches 100,000 impressions on your site.
That’s 100,000 impressions, period, not uniques. This policy allows us to on-board blogs for payment on a rolling basis, once we know how a site is performing.
For smaller blogs, we’ll help you to build audience, and we offer other perks to help you reach that benchmark number.
We don’t believe in asking bloggers to work for free, and we’re just as invested in getting more traffic to your site as you are!
Once you do hit this benchmark , we offer 20% commission on profits made on your site. That’s 20% of our profits after we get our cut from the grocer.
Payments are sent out quarterly. As our customer base grows, and our technology improves, orders may increase on your site.
Email us if you’re looking for an estimate on how much money you can expect in a quarter once you install Chicory on your site!

= I already have EasyRecipe or another recipe plugin. Can I also use Chicory? =
Yes! Chicory does not interfere with your recipe plugin  nor any other blogger tools or ad networks.

= Does Chicory affect my SEO? =
Chicory does not negatively affect your SEO. We do frequently promote your recipes on our social media sites, though, so that should help to positively affect your blog’s search ranking.

= Is there a minimum grocery order when using Chicory? =
This will depend on the grocer a reader is ordering from and whether the reader chooses pickup or delivery.
Most pickup locations do not require a minimum order. Minimum delivery sizes will vary depending on the grocer.
To meet any minimum requirements, we recommend your readers order a few recipes at once.

= Where do you deliver? =
We currently work with grocers who deliver to 24 major US markets including NYC, Boston, Chicago, DC, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Indianapolis.
We are continuously expanding to offer delivery in new areas.

= What if some of my users don’t have access to an online grocer or your grocers don’t deliver to their area? =
Chicory is still a powerful shopping tool that shows readers what national brands they should purchase in store (and the quantity of those brands) when making your recipes.
Readers can still use Chicory as a powerful shopping tool. Chicory allows readers to build a shopping list that they can then print or email to themselves,
but will also provide information as to which food brands are available for purchase in local stores.

= What if someone already has ingredients listed in a recipe? =
Easy! Our tool actually assumes you’ve got certain staples--they will appear greyed out as an optional item for readers.
Otherwise, Chicory users can deselect ingredients that they already have and those items will be taken out of the shopping cart.
